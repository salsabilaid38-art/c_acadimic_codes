# University C Programming Projects

This repository contains a collection of C programming exercises completed during my first year at university.  
Each project was designed to help me learn and practice the fundamentals of the C programming language.

## Overview

The projects in this repository cover the following topics:
- Input and output functions (`printf`, `scanf`, etc.)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Basic mathematical operations
- Working with numbers, days of the week, and more

## Example Exercises

- **Maximum of Two Numbers**  
  Write a program that reads two integers (a and b) and displays their maximum.

- **Day of the Week**  
  Write a program that reads a day number (01–07) and prints the corresponding day name (e.g., 01 = Sunday).

- **Hello World**  
  The classic example of printing "Hello World" to the screen.

## Purpose

These exercises were assigned as part of my university coursework in programming, and help illustrate the basics of C for beginners.  
The repository is intended for educational use and as a reference for anyone learning C.
